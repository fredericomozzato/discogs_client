# Discogs Client
Frederico Mozzato, December 2025

A Go client to interact with the [Discogs API](https://www.discogs.com/developers). The API already has a couple of clients but neither is written in Go. So I thought it would be a good idea to implement my own as a study project and to try and contribute to the open source community.

This is a personal project being developed to be the backbone of another personal app. If you want to request (or implement) a feature feel free to open an issue or a PR!
